# Fundamental of Generative AI

### What is Generative AI?
- AI that create original content
- Examples
    - Natural language generation - Microsoft Copilot
    - Image Generation
    - Code Generation
  
### Language Models
- language models are a specialized tyep of machine learning model that you can use to perform natural language processing tasks
  - NPL task examples
      - summarizing text
      - comparing multiple text sources for semantic similarity
      - generating new natural language
  - Category
      - Large Language Models LLMs
      - Small Language Models SLMs


### Transformer models
- are trained with large volumes of text
- components
    1. an encoder block - creates semantic representations of the training vocabulary
    2. a decoder block - generates new language sequences

- process
    - model is trained with large volume of natural language text publicly available
    - sequence of text are broken down into tokens
    - the encoder block processes these tockens sequences using a technique called attention to determine relationships between tockens
    - output from encoder is a collection of vector, each element is called embeddings
    - the decoder blocks works on a new sequence of text token and users embeddings generated by the encoder to generate an output
  
- Tokenization
    - process of breaking down training text into tokens
    - with a large set of training text, a vocabulary of many thousands of tokens could be compiled

- Embedding
    - are contextual vectors which are multi-valued numeric representations of information, numeric element representing a particular attribute of the information
  
- Attention
    - a technique used to examine a sequence of text tokens and try to quantify the strength of relationships between them


### Copilots
  - copilots are generative AI assistants that are integrated into applications often as chat interfaces.
  - provides contextual support for comon task in applications
  - use cases:
        - Web browsing using copilot.microsoft.com
        - Copilot for Microsoft 365
        - Copilot in Dynamics 365
        - Copilot in Microsoft Fabric
        - Copilot in Power BI
        - Microsoft Copilot for Security
        - Github Copilot
        - Microsoft Copilot for Azure

### Copilot Studio
  - designed to work well for well-code development scenaros to create converstional AI experiences
  - makes fully managed SaaS solution hosted in MS365 environment

### Azure AI Studio
  - PaaS development portal for professional software developer that gives full control over the language model
  - an define prompt flows that orchestrate conversation flow and integrate your own data augmentation and prompt engineering logic, and you can deploy the resulting copilot service in the cloud and consume it from custom-developed apps and services.

### GPT Models
  -   Generative pre-trained transformer
  -   understands and creates natural language
  -   takes input or prompt to return natural language virual or code response
  -   have been trained on both natural language and billions of lines of code from public repositories.
  -   able to generate code from natural language instructions such as code comments, and can suggest ways to complete code functions.

# Azure OpenAI Service
  - patnership between Microsoft and OpenAI
  - service combines Azure's enterprise-grade capabilities with OpenAI's generative AI model capabilities
  - four components
      - pre-trained generative AI models
      - customisation capabilities; fine tune AI models
      - bult-in tools to detect and mitigate harmful use cases
      - enterpise-grade security with RBAC and private networks
  - supports generative AI workloads:
      - Generative Natural Language
      - Generating Code
      - Generating Image
  - Azure AI Language service can be used for widely known use-cases that require minimal tuning.
  - Azure OpenAI Service may be more beneficial for use-cases that require highly customized generative models, or for exploratory research.

### Using Azure OpenAI
  - Can be used through REST APIs, Python SDK, or the web-based interface
  - Azure OpenAI model include
      - GPT4
      - GPT3.5
      - DALL-E
  - Playground can be used for experimenting with OpenAI models
      - Completion can be used to type prompts, configure parameters, and see response
      - Chat can be used to setup assitance to instruct the model about how it should behave


# Responsible GenAI

- Four stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI
    1. Identify potential harm
    2. Measure the presence of harms
    3. Mitigate the harms
    4. Operate the solution responsibly
