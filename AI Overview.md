# Topic: Fundamental of AI Concepts

### key workloads

- **Machine learning -** foundation of AI, way of teaching computer model to make predictions
- **Computer vision -** interpretting the world through cameras, video, and images
- **Natural language processing** - interpretting wrriten or spoken language and its response
- **Document intelligence** - managing processing and using high volumes of data forms and documents
- **Knowledge mining** - extract information unstructured data to create knowledge store
- **Generative AI**- create original content in natural language, image, code and more

### Machine Learning

How it works:
- Machines learn from data, capturing the relationship between data

#### Machine learning in MS Azure
- **Automated machine learning:** quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
- **Azure Machine Learning designer**:no-code development of machine learning solutions.
- **Data metric visualization:** analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
- **Notebooks:** write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers 

### Computer vision
- area of AI that deals with visual processing

##### Computer vision models
- image classification - classify images based on contents
- object detection - classify individual objects within an image
- semantic segmentation - classify individual pixels
- image analysis - model to extract information from images
- face detection and recognition - locates human faces in an image
- optioncal character recognition OCR - detect and read text in images

##### Computer vision services in MS Azure
- Image Analysis
- Face recognition
- Optical character recognition OCR

### Natural Language Processing NPL
Enables
- analyze and interpret texts
- interpret and translate spoken or written language
- synthesize speech responses
- interpret commands and determine appropriate actions
  
##### NPL services in Azure
- Azure AI Language
- Azure AI Speech
- Azure Speech Studio featuers AI Language and AI Speech in azure.
  
### Knowledge minning in Azure
- **Azure AI Document Intelligence** - data collection from scanned documents
- **Azire AI Search** - search solution that has tools for building indexes
  
### Generative AI in Azure
- Azure OpenAI Service - solution for deploying customising, and hosting generative AI models.

### Challenge or Risk of AI
- Bias can affect results
- Erros may cause harm
- Data could be exposed
- Solution may not work for everyone
- Users must trust complex system
- Who's liable for AI driven decisions

### Responsible AI
- Fairness
- Reliability and safety
- Privacy and security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability
  
# Topic: Fundamental of Azure AI services

Fundamental concept - use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values.

Machine Learning as a function
  - Machine learning encapsulates _function_ to calculate output
  - Process of defining the function is known as _training_
  - _Inferencing_ predicts new values.
