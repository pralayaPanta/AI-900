# Topic: Fundamental of Machine Learning

How it works:
- Machines learn from data, capturing the relationship between data

#### Machine learning in MS Azure
- **Automated machine learning:** quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
- **Azure Machine Learning designer**:no-code development of machine learning solutions.
- **Data metric visualization:** analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
- **Notebooks:** write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers 

#### Computer vision
- area of AI that deals with visual processing

##### Computer vision models
- image classification - classify images based on contents
- object detection - classify individual objects within an image
- semantic segmentation - classify individual pixels
- image analysis - model to extract information from images
- face detection and recognition - locates human faces in an image
- optioncal character recognition OCR - detect and read text in images
